# GEO — visibility in AI answers

AI engines don't rank pages, they **cite passages**. A page ranking #15 with a clean, self-contained, well-sourced answer gets cited over a #1 page that rambles. Optimize for extraction and evidence, not position.

## Three pillars

1. **Structure** — format content so a passage can be lifted out and quoted alone.
2. **Authority** — evidence density. The Princeton GEO study measured visibility lifts of **+40% from adding citations, +37% from statistics, +25% from quotes/authoritative tone**. Keyword stuffing measurably _hurts_.
3. **Presence** — LLMs weigh third-party sources heavily (Wikipedia, Reddit, reviews, comparison posts). Owned content alone caps your ceiling. Comparison content is the most-cited type (~1/3 of citations), then definitive guides and original research.

## Crawler access (prerequisite — blocked = never cited)

robots.txt must allow the AI crawlers you want citations from:

| Bot                                       | Engine                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GPTBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, `OAI-SearchBot` | OpenAI / ChatGPT search                              |
| `ClaudeBot`, `anthropic-ai`               | Anthropic / Claude                                   |
| `PerplexityBot`, `Perplexity-User`        | Perplexity                                           |
| `Google-Extended`                         | Gemini grounding (AI Overviews use normal Googlebot) |
| `Bingbot`                                 | Microsoft Copilot                                    |

Also verify in server/CDN logs that they actually hit the site — a WAF or bot-protection default can silently block them.

## Extractable formatting

- **Question-shaped H2/H3s**, each followed by a **direct 40–60 word answer** before any elaboration. That block is what gets quoted.
- Keep passages **self-contained** (~100–170 words): a reader landing mid-page understands it without the surrounding context. Name the subject; avoid "it/this" referring outside the block.
- Definitions first ("X is …"), then nuance. Comparison content in real tables. FAQs for long-tail questions.
- Give every claim a number or a source where possible — that's the +40/+37% lever.
- Content must be in the **server-rendered HTML**. Client-only rendering is invisible to most AI crawlers.

## llms.txt — honest take

`/llms.txt` is a markdown index of your site (title, summary, links to key pages) for LLM consumption. It costs minutes to serve and signals AI-friendliness, but **no major engine has confirmed using it as a citation lever** — add it, don't expect miracles from it. In Next.js: a simple route handler at `app/llms.txt/route.ts` listing the site's pages/articles with one-line summaries.

## Don'ts (these backfire)

- No separate "AI version" of content, no page chunking into fragments, no AI-keyword rewriting — Google treats GEO/AEO tricks as the same spam it already polices.
- No scaled low-value generation, no inauthentic third-party mentions (fake Reddit posts, planted reviews).

## Monitoring

- Monthly: run 5–10 priority queries through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google (AI Overviews); log whether you're cited and who is instead.
- Analytics: segment referrals from `chatgpt.com`, `perplexity.ai`, `claude.ai`, `gemini.google.com`.
- Logs: track AI-bot crawl volume as a leading indicator.

- **jterrazz-seo** — the technical base (crawlable, indexed, fast) is a prerequisite; GEO doesn't rescue an uncrawlable site.
- **jterrazz-structured-data** — entity clarity (Person/Organization/Article) helps engines attribute content.
- **jterrazz-content-reach** — the presence pillar: earning third-party mentions.
